      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="Assets/Images/g.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>I am a Virginia Army National Guard veteran with six months of experience as a full stack web developer. I thoroughly enjoy the more logical-based programming languages, like Javascript. To me, it is a large puzzle that you are tasked with assembling. The only difference is that you have to design the pieces yourself, and then reassemble them. </p>

      <p>Whereas with a normal puzzle, each piece is designed to fit in a specific spot. With programming, there are many different ways a puzzle piece can fit into the larger picture. Finding creative solutions to problems, or even alternative ways to complete the same objective, is extremely satisfying and rewarding.</p>

      <p>I am very passionate about creating products that are exciting, innovative and aesthetically pleasing to the consumer. My experience in a customer-facing position for a nationwide corporation, has given me the opportunity to view firsthand the impacts of policies, procedures and products, as well, as the motivators of the consumer.</p>
